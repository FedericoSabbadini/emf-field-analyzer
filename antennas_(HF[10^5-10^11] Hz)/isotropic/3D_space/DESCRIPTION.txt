1. ANTENNA CHARACTERISTICS
================================================================================

Type: Isotropic Radiator (Theoretical Reference)

Definition:
An isotropic antenna is a hypothetical lossless antenna that radiates
electromagnetic waves uniformly in all directions with equal intensity.

Key Properties:
- Radiation pattern: F(θ,φ) = 1 (constant, independent of direction)
- Directivity: D = 1 (0 dBi by definition)
- Gain: G = 1 (0 dBi, assuming lossless)
- Polarization: Not defined (theoretical construct)

Physical Realizability:
An isotropic antenna CANNOT be physically constructed. It violates the
Helmholtz wave equation constraint that requires sources to have some
directional variation. However, it serves as an invaluable REFERENCE for
comparing real antenna performance.

================================================================================
2. ELECTRIC FIELD EQUATIONS
================================================================================

FAR-FIELD ELECTRIC FIELD:

For an isotropic antenna with transmitted power P_tx:

    E(r) = √(30 · EIRP) / r = √(30 · P_tx · G) / r

Since G = 1 for isotropic:

    E(r) = √(30 · P_tx) / r = k / r

where k = √(30 · P_tx) is a constant.

SIMULATION PARAMETERS:
- k = 4 (corresponds to P_tx = k²/30 = 0.53 W)
- This represents a low-power transmitter

FIELD VALUES:
    E(0.1 m) = 40 V/m
    E(0.67 m) = 6 V/m (attention value)
    E(1 m) = 4 V/m
    E(2 m) = 2 V/m
    E(10 m) = 0.4 V/m

ISOSURFACE GEOMETRY:

For E = E_target (constant), solving k/r = E_target:

    r = k / E_target

This defines a SPHERE centered at the antenna position.

For E = 6 V/m with k = 4:
    r = 4/6 = 0.67 m

The isosurface is a sphere of radius 0.67 m.

================================================================================
3. POWER DENSITY
================================================================================

The power density (Poynting vector) for an isotropic antenna:

    S(r) = P_tx / (4πr²) = EIRP / (4πr²) [W/m²]

Alternatively, from the electric field:

    S = E² / Z₀ = E² / 377 [W/m²]

For E = 6 V/m:
    S = 36/377 = 0.095 W/m² ≈ 0.1 W/m² (attention value)

================================================================================
4. VISUALIZATION DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

3D ISOSURFACE PLOT:

The visualization shows a semi-transparent orange sphere representing the
locus of all points where E = 6 V/m (the Italian attention value).

Key Features:
- Perfect spherical shape (isotropic radiation)
- Antenna position marked at center (red dot)
- Sphere radius = 0.67 m for the given parameters

Physical Interpretation:
- Inside the sphere: E > 6 V/m (higher exposure)
- On the sphere: E = 6 V/m (threshold)
- Outside the sphere: E < 6 V/m (lower exposure)

================================================================================
5. COMPARISON WITH DIRECTIVE ANTENNAS
================================================================================

The isotropic antenna distributes power uniformly in 4π steradians.
Real antennas concentrate power in preferred directions:

                    Isotropic   Dipole    Yagi     Parabolic
Gain [dBi]          0           2.15      8-15     30-50
Beam solid angle    4π sr       5.0 sr    1-0.1 sr 10⁻⁴-10⁻⁶ sr
Max range for 6V/m  0.67 m      0.86 m    1.7-4 m  21-210 m

The higher the gain, the farther the field extends in the main beam direction,
but it falls off more rapidly off-axis.

================================================================================
6. EIRP AND POWER RELATIONSHIPS
================================================================================

EIRP (Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power):

The EIRP is the power that would need to be fed to an isotropic antenna to
produce the same peak power density as the actual antenna:

    EIRP = P_tx · G_max

Example calculations:
- P_tx = 10 W, G = 10 dBi (10×): EIRP = 100 W
- P_tx = 1 W, G = 20 dBi (100×): EIRP = 100 W

Both produce the same peak field strength in the main beam.

FIELD FROM EIRP:

    E_max = √(30 · EIRP) / r [V/m]

For EIRP = 100 W:
    E(1 m) = √3000 = 54.8 V/m
    E(10 m) = 5.48 V/m

================================================================================
7. REGULATORY CONTEXT
================================================================================

ITALIAN LIMITS (DPCM 8 July 2003):

For frequencies 0.1 - 300 GHz:
- Exposure limit: 20 V/m
- Attention value: 6 V/m (visualized in this simulation)
- Quality objective: 6 V/m

EXCLUSION ZONE CALCULATION:

Given EIRP, the radius r where E equals a limit value E_lim is:

    r_exclusion = √(30 · EIRP) / E_lim

For EIRP = 100 W:
    r(20 V/m) = 54.8/20 = 2.74 m (exposure limit zone)
    r(6 V/m) = 54.8/6 = 9.13 m (attention zone)

================================================================================
8. APPLICATIONS OF ISOTROPIC REFERENCE
================================================================================

1. ANTENNA GAIN DEFINITION:
   Gain is always specified relative to isotropic (dBi)

2. LINK BUDGET CALCULATIONS:
   Free-space path loss uses isotropic assumption as baseline

3. COVERAGE PLANNING:
   Isotropic model provides conservative (worst-case) estimates

4. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE:
   EIRP is the standard metric for transmitter power limits

5. MEASUREMENT CALIBRATION:
   Reference antennas approach isotropic in certain planes

================================================================================
9. MATHEMATICAL NOTES
================================================================================

FIELD DERIVATION FROM MAXWELL'S EQUATIONS:

For a time-harmonic point source (isotropic), the electric field in
spherical coordinates is:

    E_r = 0 (transverse wave, no radial component in far field)
    E_θ = (jkη₀I₀ℓ/4πr) · sin(θ) · e^(-jkr)  [for short dipole]

For true isotropic (impossible), would require:
    E = const/r  (independent of θ,φ)

This violates ∇·E = 0 at the origin, proving isotropic radiation is
physically impossible for a point source.
