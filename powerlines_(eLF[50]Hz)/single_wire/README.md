# Single Wire - Fundamental Magnetic Field Analysis

## Overview

This section analyzes the magnetic field generated by a **single infinitely long straight conductor** carrying alternating current. This is the fundamental building block for understanding all power line configurations.

## Physical Model

### Assumptions
1. The wire is infinitely long (valid when observation distance << wire length)
2. The wire has negligible radius (thin wire approximation)
3. Current distribution is uniform across the cross-section
4. The medium is non-magnetic (μᵣ = 1, i.e., air)

### Biot-Savart Solution

For a wire along the z-axis at position (xₛ, yₛ):

```
B = (μ₀ · I) / (2π · r)

where r = √[(x - xₛ)² + (y - yₛ)²]
```

### Field Direction

The magnetic field is **azimuthal** (tangential to circles centered on the wire):
- Direction follows the **right-hand rule**: thumb along current, fingers curl in B direction
- No radial component (B_r = 0)
- No axial component (B_z = 0)

### Cartesian Components

```
Bₓ = -B · sin(φ) = -B · (y - yₛ) / r
Bᵧ = +B · cos(φ) = +B · (x - xₛ) / r
Bᵤ = 0
```

Where φ is the azimuthal angle measured from the positive x-axis.

## Numerical Example

For a typical medium-voltage distribution line:
- Current: I = 100 A
- At r = 1 m: B = 20 μT
- At r = 10 m: B = 2 μT
- At r = 100 m: B = 0.2 μT

### Distance for Regulatory Limits

Using B = μ₀I/(2πr), solving for r:

```
r = μ₀I / (2π · B)
```

For I = 100 A:
- B = 100 μT (exposure limit): r = 0.2 m
- B = 10 μT (attention value): r = 2 m
- B = 3 μT (quality objective): r = 6.7 m

## Field Properties

1. **Magnitude**: Inversely proportional to distance (1/r decay)
2. **Direction**: Tangential, circling the wire
3. **Time variation**: Sinusoidal at 50 Hz (or 60 Hz)
4. **Polarization**: Linear (single wire), elliptical (multiple wires)

## Observation Plane Effects

When the observation plane does **not** contain the wire:
- Field magnitude depends only on **perpendicular distance** to wire
- Field appears **constant** along the wire direction
- Isolines are **parallel straight lines** in the observation plane

When the observation plane is **perpendicular** to the wire:
- Field exhibits **circular symmetry**
- Isolines are **concentric circles**
- Wire position appears as a **singular point**
