# Two Parallel Wires - Field Superposition Analysis

## Overview

This section analyzes the magnetic field generated by **two parallel infinite wires** carrying current. The two configurations studied demonstrate the fundamental principle of **vector superposition** and its practical implications for field reduction.

## Configurations

### 1. In-Phase Currents (Same Direction)
Both wires carry current in the same direction. The magnetic fields **reinforce** each other in certain regions, leading to higher overall field levels.

**Applications:**
- Parallel busbars in substations
- High-current DC applications
- Poorly designed single-phase returns

### 2. Opposite-Phase Currents (Return Path)
Wires carry current in opposite directions, representing a supply and return path. The fields **partially cancel**, reducing far-field exposure.

**Applications:**
- Single-phase power cables (line + neutral)
- DC power transmission (bipolar)
- Twisted pair cables (principle)

## Mathematical Analysis

### Superposition Principle

For two wires at positions (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) with currents I₁ and I₂:

```
B⃗_total = B⃗₁ + B⃗₂

Bₓ_total = Bₓ₁ + Bₓ₂
Bᵧ_total = Bᵧ₁ + Bᵧ₂

|B_total| = √(Bₓ_total² + Bᵧ_total²)
```

### Far-Field Approximation (r >> d)

For two wires separated by distance **d** with opposite currents:

**In-phase currents (I₁ = I₂ = I):**
```
B(r) ≈ (μ₀ · 2I) / (2π · r)    [1/r decay]
```

**Opposite currents (I₁ = +I, I₂ = -I):**
```
B(r) ≈ (μ₀ · I · d) / (2π · r²)    [1/r² decay]
```

The faster 1/r² decay significantly reduces field levels at distance.

## Quantitative Comparison

For I = 100 A, d = 10 m separation:

| Distance [m] | In-Phase B [μT] | Opposite B [μT] | Reduction |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 10 | 4.0 | 2.0 | 50% |
| 20 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 75% |
| 50 | 0.8 | 0.08 | 90% |
| 100 | 0.4 | 0.02 | 95% |

## Key Physical Insights

1. **Cancellation mechanism**: Opposite currents create opposing magnetic fields that subtract vectorially.

2. **Distance dependency**: Close to the wires, individual fields dominate. Far from wires, cancellation is more effective.

3. **Optimal spacing**: For maximum cancellation, wires should be as close as possible (limited by insulation requirements).

4. **Null line**: With opposite currents, a null line exists on the symmetry plane between wires (where x = 0 for wires at x = ±d/2).

## Engineering Implications

- **Cable design**: Keeping conductors close together minimizes stray magnetic fields
- **EMC considerations**: Twisted pairs exploit this principle at high frequencies
- **Exposure reduction**: Return paths should be routed close to feed lines
