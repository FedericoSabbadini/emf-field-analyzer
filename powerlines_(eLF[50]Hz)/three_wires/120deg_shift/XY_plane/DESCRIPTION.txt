================================================================================
2. THREE-PHASE CURRENT THEORY
================================================================================

INSTANTANEOUS CURRENTS:

The three phase currents as functions of time:

    i_R(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt)
    i_S(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt - 2π/3)
    i_T(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt - 4π/3)

where:
    ω = 2πf = 2π × 50 = 314.16 rad/s
    I₀ = 400 A (RMS)
    I₀√2 = 565.7 A (peak)

PHASOR REPRESENTATION:

Using complex exponential notation:

    Ĩ_R = I₀ · e^(j·0°)     = 400∠0° A       = 400 + j0 A
    Ĩ_S = I₀ · e^(j·120°)   = 400∠120° A     = -200 + j346.4 A
    Ĩ_T = I₀ · e^(j·240°)   = 400∠240° A     = -200 - j346.4 A

FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY - ZERO SUM:

    Ĩ_R + Ĩ_S + Ĩ_T = (400) + (-200 + j346.4) + (-200 - j346.4)
                     = (400 - 200 - 200) + j(0 + 346.4 - 346.4)
                     = 0 + j0
                     = 0

This zero-sum property is the foundation of magnetic field cancellation.

================================================================================
3. MAGNETIC FIELD COMPUTATION
================================================================================

COMPLEX FIELD SUPERPOSITION:

The magnetic field from each wire is computed using Biot-Savart:

    B̃ₖ = (μ₀ · Ĩₖ) / (2π · rₖ)

Total field (complex vector sum):

    B̃ₓ_total = Σₖ B̃ₖ · (x - xₖ) / rₖ
    B̃ᵧ_total = Σₖ B̃ₖ · (y - yₖ) / rₖ

Field magnitude (RMS):

    |B| = √(|B̃ₓ|² + |B̃ᵧ|²)

FAR-FIELD BEHAVIOR:

At distances r >> conductor spacing d:

Without phase shift (all in-phase):
    B ≈ μ₀(3I₀)/(2πr) ∝ 1/r

With 120° phase shift:
    B ≈ μ₀I₀d²/(2πr²) ∝ 1/r²

The 120° shift transforms the source from monopole-like to quadrupole-like,
causing faster field decay with distance.

================================================================================
4. NUMERICAL RESULTS
================================================================================

FIELD VALUES AT KEY DISTANCES:

Distance [m] | B [μT]  | Regulatory Status
-------------|---------|------------------
     1       |  ~200   | Near-field (close to wires)
     5       |  ~35    | Below exposure limit
    10       |  ~12    | Above attention value
    15       |  ~6     | Near attention value
    20       |  ~4     | Below attention value
    30       |  ~2     | Below quality objective
    40       |  ~1.2   | Very low exposure

COMPARISON WITH NO PHASE SHIFT:

At 20 m distance:
- No shift:    B ≈ 24 μT
- 120° shift:  B ≈ 4 μT
- Reduction:   ~83%

At 50 m distance:
- No shift:    B ≈ 9.6 μT
- 120° shift:  B ≈ 0.9 μT
- Reduction:   ~91%

================================================================================
5. FIELD POLARIZATION
================================================================================

Unlike single-wire fields (linearly polarized), three-phase fields exhibit
ELLIPTICAL POLARIZATION due to the rotating magnetic field effect.

At any fixed observation point, the B-field vector traces an ellipse during
one AC cycle. The ellipse parameters (axial ratio, tilt) depend on position.

On the symmetry axis (y-axis):
- Polarization approaches circular
- Field rotates at 50 Hz (3000 rpm equivalent)

This rotating field property is exploited in three-phase induction motors.

6. VISUALIZATION DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

LEFT PANEL - 3D SURFACE:
- Shows field magnitude as height above XY plane
- Central region: superposition effects visible
- Far field: smooth decay demonstrating 1/r² behavior
- Hot colormap: Yellow (high) → Dark red (low)

RIGHT PANEL - CONTOUR PLOT:
- Isolines at 3, 10, 30 μT (regulatory-relevant levels)
- Three colored dots: Phase positions (R=blue, S=red, T=green)
- Contours are NOT circular (unlike single wire)
- Shape reflects vector cancellation pattern

================================================================================
7. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

NEAR-FIELD REGION (r < 2d):
- Individual wire contributions dominate
- Field shape is complex, showing three peaks
- Phase relationships cause local maxima/minima

INTERMEDIATE REGION (2d < r < 10d):
- Cancellation begins to be significant
- Contours transition from complex to quasi-circular
- Decay faster than 1/r but not yet 1/r²

FAR-FIELD REGION (r > 10d):
- Effective quadrupole behavior
- Field decays as 1/r²
- Nearly circular contours

SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS:
- The horizontal arrangement has bilateral symmetry about y-axis
- Field is symmetric: B(x,y) = B(-x,y)
- Maximum field is NOT directly above center wire (due to phase effects)

================================================================================
8. ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS
================================================================================

RIGHT-OF-WAY DETERMINATION:
For a 132 kV line with 400 A/phase:
- 100 μT limit: ~3 m clearance
- 10 μT attention: ~15 m clearance
- 3 μT quality: ~25 m clearance

COMPARISON WITH SINGLE-PHASE:
A single-phase line carrying 1200 A (equivalent power) would require:
- 3 μT quality: ~80 m clearance (3× larger!)

This demonstrates the environmental advantage of three-phase transmission.

UNDERGROUND CABLES:
Three-phase cables in trefoil configuration achieve even better cancellation:
- Reduced conductor spacing (insulation-limited)
- Typical fields: 1-10 μT at 1 m depth, <0.1 μT at surface

================================================================================
9. LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS
================================================================================

MODEL LIMITATIONS:
1. Assumes infinite wire length (valid for r << line length)
2. Neglects sag and terrain effects
3. Assumes balanced currents (real systems may have imbalance)
4. Ignores ground return currents

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS:
- Include finite wire length effects
- Add earth return current modeling
- Account for conductor sag (catenary)
- Model double-circuit lines (6 wires)
- Include tower/structure effects
