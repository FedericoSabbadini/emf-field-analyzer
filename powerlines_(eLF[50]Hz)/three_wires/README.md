# Three-Phase Power Systems - Advanced Field Analysis

## Overview

Three-phase alternating current is the dominant method for **electrical power transmission and distribution** worldwide. This section analyzes the magnetic field generated by three-phase systems, comparing the idealized "in-phase" case with the real "120° phase shift" configuration.

## Why Three-Phase?

Three-phase systems offer significant advantages over single-phase:

1. **Constant power delivery**: Instantaneous power is constant (no pulsation)
2. **Efficient transmission**: 50% less conductor material for same power
3. **Rotating magnetic fields**: Essential for AC motors
4. **Field cancellation**: Reduced environmental EMF exposure

## Phase Relationships

### Balanced Three-Phase Currents

The three currents are equal in magnitude but displaced by 120° in phase:

```
i_R(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt)           → Ĩ_R = I₀∠0°
i_S(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt - 120°)    → Ĩ_S = I₀∠-120°
i_T(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt - 240°)    → Ĩ_T = I₀∠-240°
```

### Critical Property: Zero Sum

```
Ĩ_R + Ĩ_S + Ĩ_T = I₀[1 + e^(-j120°) + e^(-j240°)]
                 = I₀[1 + (-0.5 - j0.866) + (-0.5 + j0.866)]
                 = I₀[0]
                 = 0
```

This **phasor sum of zero** is the key to magnetic field cancellation.

## Configurations Analyzed

### 1. In-Phase (No Shift) - Educational Reference
All three currents are in phase (no 120° shift). This unrealistic scenario serves as a reference to demonstrate the benefit of phase displacement.

**Characteristics:**
- Maximum possible field (sum of individual contributions)
- 1/r field decay (single monopole behavior)
- No cancellation

### 2. 120° Phase Shift - Real Three-Phase
Actual three-phase system with balanced 120° phase displacement.

**Characteristics:**
- Significant field reduction at distance
- 1/r² field decay (quadrupole-like behavior)
- Partial near-field cancellation

## Mathematical Formulation

### Complex Phasor Representation

For three wires at positions (x₁, 0), (x₂, 0), (x₃, 0):

```
B⃗_total = Σ B⃗ₖ

where B⃗ₖ = (μ₀ · Ĩₖ) / (2π · rₖ) · φ̂ₖ
```

The total field is the **vector sum of complex phasors**, capturing both magnitude and phase.

### Field Decay Comparison

| Distance | In-Phase (3×400A) | 120° Shift (400A/phase) |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 5 m | 96 μT | 35 μT |
| 10 m | 48 μT | 12 μT |
| 20 m | 24 μT | 4 μT |
| 50 m | 9.6 μT | 0.9 μT |

## Practical Implications

### Power Transmission Lines

Modern high-voltage transmission lines use three-phase systems to:
1. Minimize magnetic field footprint
2. Reduce right-of-way requirements
3. Meet environmental exposure limits

### Conductor Arrangements

Common configurations:
- **Horizontal**: R-S-T in a row (analyzed here)
- **Vertical**: Stacked vertically on towers
- **Delta**: Triangular arrangement
- **Double-circuit**: Two three-phase sets on same tower

Each arrangement has different field cancellation characteristics.

### Underground Cables

Three-phase cables in close trefoil formation achieve maximum cancellation, with typical field levels 10-100× lower than overhead lines at equivalent distances.

## Regulatory Compliance

For a typical 132 kV line (400 A/phase):

| Limit | Distance Required (In-Phase) | Distance Required (120° Shift) |
|-------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 100 μT | ~5 m | ~3 m |
| 10 μT | ~50 m | ~15 m |
| 3 μT | ~170 m | ~25 m |

The 120° phase shift dramatically reduces the required buffer zone.
