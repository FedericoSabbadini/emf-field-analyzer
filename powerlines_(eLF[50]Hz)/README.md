# Power Lines - ELF Magnetic Field Analysis (50 Hz)

## Physical Principles

This module simulates the **quasi-static magnetic field** generated by high-voltage power transmission lines operating at the industrial frequency of 50 Hz (European standard) or 60 Hz (North American standard).

At these extremely low frequencies (ELF), the wavelength is approximately **6000 km**, which is vastly larger than any practical observation distance. Therefore, the electromagnetic field can be treated as **quasi-static**, meaning:
- The electric and magnetic fields are decoupled
- Propagation effects are negligible
- The Biot-Savart law applies directly

## Governing Equations

### Single Infinite Wire (Biot-Savart Law)

For an infinitely long straight conductor carrying current **I** along the z-axis:

```
B(r) = (μ₀ · I) / (2π · r)
```

The magnetic field forms concentric circles around the wire (right-hand rule), with magnitude inversely proportional to the radial distance **r**.

**Vector components** in Cartesian coordinates for a wire at position (xₛ, yₛ):
```
Bₓ = -B · (y - yₛ) / r    (tangential component)
Bᵧ = +B · (x - xₛ) / r    (tangential component)
Bᵤ = 0                    (no axial component)
```

### Multiple Wires - Superposition Principle

For **N** parallel wires, the total magnetic field is the **vector sum** of individual contributions:

```
B_total = Σᵢ Bᵢ

Bₓ_total = Σᵢ Bₓᵢ
Bᵧ_total = Σᵢ Bᵧᵢ

|B_total| = √(Bₓ_total² + Bᵧ_total²)
```

### Three-Phase Systems

In a balanced three-phase power system, the currents are sinusoidal with 120° phase shifts:

```
i₁(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt)
i₂(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt - 120°)
i₃(t) = I₀√2 · cos(ωt - 240°)
```

Using **phasor notation** (complex amplitudes):
```
Ĩ₁ = I₀ · e^(j·0°)   = I₀
Ĩ₂ = I₀ · e^(j·2π/3) = I₀(-0.5 + j·0.866)
Ĩ₃ = I₀ · e^(j·4π/3) = I₀(-0.5 - j·0.866)
```

**Critical property**: Ĩ₁ + Ĩ₂ + Ĩ₃ = 0

This vector cancellation causes the magnetic field to decay as **1/r²** at large distances (compared to 1/r for a single wire), significantly reducing environmental exposure.

## Field Decay Comparison

| Configuration | Near-field decay | Far-field decay | Effective source |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Single wire | 1/r | 1/r | Monopole |
| Two wires (opposite currents) | 1/r | 1/r² | Dipole |
| Three-phase (120° shift) | 1/r | 1/r² | Quadrupole-like |

## Typical Current Values

| Voltage Level | Typical Current | Application |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 220 V (LV) | 10-100 A | Residential |
| 20 kV (MV) | 100-400 A | Urban distribution |
| 132 kV (HV) | 200-800 A | Regional transmission |
| 380 kV (EHV) | 500-2000 A | National grid |

## Key Observations

1. **Single wire**: Circular field lines, 1/r decay, useful for understanding basics
2. **Two wires in phase**: Field reinforcement between wires
3. **Two wires opposite phase**: Partial cancellation, faster decay at distance
4. **Three-phase balanced**: Maximum cancellation, 1/r² decay, lowest environmental impact
