## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive MATLAB-based toolkit for computing and visualizing electromagnetic fields generated by common sources of electromagnetic pollution (electrosmog). The simulations cover both **Extremely Low Frequency (ELF)** fields from power transmission lines and **High Frequency (HF/RF)** fields from radio antennas.

## Physical Background

### Magnetic Field from Power Lines (ELF)

Power transmission lines carry alternating current at 50 Hz (Europe) or 60 Hz (USA). The magnetic field **B** around an infinite straight conductor is given by the **Biot-Savart law**:

```
B = (μ₀ · I) / (2π · r)
```

Where:
- **μ₀** = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m (permeability of free space)
- **I** = current magnitude [A]
- **r** = perpendicular distance from the wire [m]

The field decays as **1/r** for a single wire, but for balanced three-phase systems, mutual cancellation causes the field to decay as **1/r²**, significantly reducing far-field exposure.

### Electric Field from Antennas (HF/RF)

Radio frequency antennas generate electromagnetic waves. In the **far-field region** (r >> λ), the electric field magnitude is:

```
E = √(30 · EIRP) / r · F(θ,φ)
```

Where:
- **EIRP** = Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power [W]
- **r** = distance from antenna [m]
- **F(θ,φ)** = normalized radiation pattern (antenna-specific)

## Regulatory Limits

### Italy - DPCM 8 July 2003

#### Magnetic Fields (50 Hz)
| Level | Value | Application |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Exposure limit | 100 μT | Never to be exceeded |
| Attention value | 10 μT | Areas with >4h daily presence |
| Quality objective | 3 μT | New installations near sensitive areas |

#### Electric Fields (100 kHz - 300 GHz)
| Level | Value | Application |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Exposure limit | 20 V/m | Short-term exposure |

## How to Use

Each simulation folder contains:
1. **`simulation.m`** - MATLAB script (clean, executable code)
2. **`output.png`** - Pre-generated visualization
3. **`DESCRIPTION.txt`** - Detailed technical explanation

To run a simulation:
```matlab
cd powerlines_ELF_50Hz/three_phase/120deg_shift/XY_plane
run simulation.m
```

## Mathematical Formulations

### Vector Superposition
For multiple sources, the total field is computed by vector addition:
```
B_total = Σ Bᵢ (vector sum)
|B_total| = √(Bₓ² + Bᵧ² + Bᵤ²)
```

### Three-Phase Current Phasors
In a balanced three-phase system:
```
I₁ = I₀ · e^(j·0°)     = I₀
I₂ = I₀ · e^(j·120°)   = I₀(-½ + j√3/2)
I₃ = I₀ · e^(j·240°)   = I₀(-½ - j√3/2)
```
**Key property**: I₁ + I₂ + I₃ = 0 (phasor sum is zero)

### Antenna Radiation Patterns
| Antenna Type | Pattern F(θ,φ) | Characteristics |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Isotropic | 1 | Uniform sphere (theoretical reference) |
| Short Dipole | sin(θ) | Toroidal, null along axis |
| Yagi-Uda | sin(θ)·sin(φ) | Directional lobes |
| Parabolic | cos²(θ) | Narrow pencil beam |
